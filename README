I am finding using Java syntax and library includes unintuitive


Mirah Standard Library, is a attempt to have rubyish library to abstract java classes, basically syntactic sugar


adding common rubyish methods  to all Mirah Standard classes


expect these methods in most classes
to_s,to_i,to_f,methods,public_methods,is_a?,kind_of?,

nice to haves
inspect, send, each, method_missing, instance_variables, constants, ancestors

adding one method "help" which prints sample code for the class, making it useful for newbies to 





building
uses a simple bash script, modify to suit your taste
sh compile.sh #clean generated files then compile the code
sh clean.sh #clean generated code



usage
mirahc mirah.mirah
mirahc usage.mirah
java Usage

sample program

import mirah.MString

sint = MString.new("20")
sfloat=MString.new("20.5")
puts sint.to_i
puts sfloat.to_f
puts sint.help
